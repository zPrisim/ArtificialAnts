## Description  
**ArtificialAnts** is a small simulation project made with **Godot 4.4.1** that models simple autonomous agents, represented as ants, moving and interacting in a 2D environment.  
The goal of the project is to experiment with basic AI behaviors such as movement, exploration, and resource detection inside the Godot engine.  

This project was developed during my **laboratory internship at the end of my first year of the Master's degree in Computer Science (M1)**.  
It served as a practical experiment to explore agent-based modeling and the implementation of autonomous systems within a game engine using GDScript.  

## Features  
- Built entirely in **Godot 4.4.1** using GDScript  
- Autonomous agents (ants) that move and react to their environment  
- Simple simulation logic focused on movement and interaction with food
- Randomly generated map at the start of the simulation  
- Real-time map editing directly through the built-in UI  
- Adjustable simulation speed via the interface  
- Additional parameters and settings can be tweaked through the UI

## Installation
If you just want to try the project without cloning it, you can check out an online demo here:  
[https://virtulab.univ-brest.fr/simcells-3.html](https://virtulab.univ-brest.fr/simcells-3.html)  

To run it locally: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zPrisim/ArtificialAnts.git
   ```
Then open the project in Godot 4.4.1 by selecting the project.godot file, and run the game using the play button.
